# Gravitational waves from pure and hybrid cosmic string defects
We introduce the public code `CosmicStringGW` that enables the calculation of gravitational waves from pure cosmic strings and hybrid topological defects involving cosmic strings. The current version includes the calculation of gravitational wave spectrum for pure gauged Nambu-Goto strings and "domain walls bounded by cosmic strings". Future updates will include global strings and other topological defects.
